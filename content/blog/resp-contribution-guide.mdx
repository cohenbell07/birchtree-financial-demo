# RESP Contribution Guide: Saving for Your Child's Education

A Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) is one of the most effective ways to save for your child's post-secondary education in Canada. With government grants that can boost your savings by up to 30%, RESPs offer significant advantages for Canadian families planning for their children's future.

## Understanding RESPs in 2026

An RESP is a tax-sheltered savings plan designed specifically for post-secondary education expenses. Contributions grow tax-free, and while contributions aren't tax-deductible, the investment earnings are taxed in the student's hands when withdrawn—typically resulting in little or no tax since students generally have lower income.

## RESP Contribution Limits

### Lifetime Contribution Limit

The lifetime contribution limit per beneficiary is **$50,000** as of 2026. This limit has remained stable and applies to all contributions made for a single child across all RESPs.

### Annual Contribution Limits

There are no specific annual contribution limits, but to maximize government grants, you should consider the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) limits discussed below.

## Government Grants and Benefits

### Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG)

The CESG is the primary government incentive for RESP contributions:

- **Basic CESG**: The government matches 20% of your contributions, up to $500 per year per child (based on $2,500 in contributions)
- **Maximum lifetime CESG**: $7,200 per child
- **Catch-up grants**: If you miss contributing in previous years, you can catch up on one year of unused CESG room per calendar year

**For 2026 contributions:**
- Contribute $2,500 → Receive $500 in CESG (20% match)
- Contribute $5,000 → Receive $1,000 in CESG (if you have catch-up room)
- Maximum annual CESG: $1,000 per child ($500 basic + $500 catch-up)

### Additional Grants for Lower-Income Families

**Canada Learning Bond (CLB):**
- Available to children from low-income families
- Provides $500 in the first year and $100 per year for eligible years
- No contributions required—the government deposits the funds
- Maximum lifetime CLB: $2,000 per child

**Additional CESG:**
- Lower-income families may be eligible for an extra 10% or 20% on the first $500 of annual contributions
- This can increase the CESG from $500 to $550 or $600 on the first $500 contributed

## RESP Investment Options

RESPs offer flexibility in investment choices:

### 1. Individual Plans
- You control the investments
- Can invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and GICs
- Requires active management and investment knowledge

### 2. Group Plans (Scholarship Plans)
- Pooled investments managed by scholarship plan dealers
- Typically invested in fixed-income securities
- Returns depend on group performance and number of participants
- May have fees and restrictions

### 3. Family Plans
- Can name multiple children as beneficiaries
- Useful for families with more than one child
- Allows flexibility in distributing funds among beneficiaries

## Strategic Contribution Strategies

### Start Early

The earlier you start contributing, the more time your investments have to grow, and the more government grants you can receive. Starting when your child is born maximizes the benefit of compound growth.

### Maximize the CESG Match

To maximize government grants, contribute at least $2,500 per year per child. This ensures you receive the full $500 basic CESG annually.

### Use Catch-Up Contributions Strategically

If you missed contributing in previous years, you can catch up on one year of unused CESG room annually. This means you could contribute $5,000 in a single year and receive $1,000 in CESG ($500 for the current year + $500 catch-up).

### Consider Family Income

Lower-income families should prioritize RESP contributions to take advantage of additional grants like the CLB and enhanced CESG. Even small contributions can unlock significant government benefits.

## RESP Withdrawals

### Educational Assistance Payments (EAPs)

When your child enrolls in post-secondary education, they can withdraw:

- **EAPs**: Government grants and investment earnings (taxed as income to the student)
- **Post-Secondary Education Payments (PSEPs)**: Your original contributions (tax-free)

### Eligible Educational Institutions

Withdrawals can be used for:
- Universities and colleges in Canada
- Many international institutions
- Trade schools and apprenticeship programs
- Part-time or full-time studies

### Withdrawal Planning

Students can withdraw funds throughout their education. Consider:
- Withdrawing EAPs (grants and earnings) early in the program when the student has lower income (potentially paying less tax)
- Using PSEPs (contributions) strategically to manage taxable income
- Planning withdrawals to align with tuition and living expenses

## What Happens If Your Child Doesn't Attend Post-Secondary?

If your child doesn't pursue post-secondary education, you have options:

1. **Transfer to another child**: If you have a family RESP, you can transfer funds to another beneficiary
2. **Wait**: RESPs can remain open for up to 36 years, giving your child time to decide
3. **Close the RESP**: You can withdraw your contributions tax-free, but:
   - Government grants must be returned
   - Investment earnings are taxed as income plus a 20% penalty (unless transferred to your RRSP)

## Common RESP Mistakes to Avoid

### Not Maximizing Government Grants

Many families don't contribute enough to maximize the CESG match. Even if you can't afford $2,500 per year, contributing something is better than nothing—you'll still receive grants on your contributions.

### Starting Too Late

The longer you wait to start an RESP, the less time your investments have to grow and the fewer government grants you can receive. Start as early as possible, even if contributions are small initially.

### Choosing the Wrong Investment Strategy

RESPs have a relatively short investment horizon (typically 18 years or less). Avoid overly conservative strategies that won't keep pace with education cost inflation, but also be mindful of risk as you approach withdrawal time.

### Not Understanding Plan Fees

Some RESP providers, particularly group plans, charge significant fees. Understand all fees before opening an RESP, and consider whether the benefits justify the costs.

## Coordinating RESPs with Other Savings

RESPs should be part of a broader financial plan:

- **TFSAs**: Can supplement RESP savings or serve as backup education funding
- **Non-registered accounts**: Provide additional flexibility for education expenses
- **RRSPs**: While not ideal for education savings, can be used in emergency situations
