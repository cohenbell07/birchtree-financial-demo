# CPP and OAS Changes: What You Need to Know

Canada's public pension system provides a foundation for retirement security, and 2026 brings important updates to both the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) programs. Understanding these changes is crucial for effective retirement planning.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Updates for 2026

### Maximum CPP Benefits

For 2026, the maximum CPP retirement pension at age 65 is **$1,364.60 per month**, up from $1,364.60 in 2025. This represents a modest increase that reflects cost-of-living adjustments.

### Enhanced CPP (CPP2)

The Enhanced CPP, which began in 2019, continues to phase in for 2026. This enhancement increases benefits for middle-income earners and provides additional retirement security. The enhanced portion applies to earnings above the Year's Basic Exempt Amount (YBE) up to an additional threshold.

### Key CPP Dates for 2026

- **January 1, 2026**: New contribution rates and maximum pensionable earnings take effect
- **Age 60**: Earliest age to start receiving CPP (with permanent reduction)
- **Age 65**: Standard retirement age (full benefits)
- **Age 70**: Latest age to start CPP (with permanent increase)

### CPP Contribution Rates

Both employees and employers contribute 5.95% of pensionable earnings up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE), which is $73,200 for 2026. Self-employed individuals pay both portions, totaling 11.9%.

## Old Age Security (OAS) Updates for 2026

### OAS Payment Amounts

For 2026, the maximum OAS pension is **$713.34 per month** for individuals 65 and older. This amount is adjusted quarterly based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

### OAS Clawback Threshold

The OAS clawback (recovery tax) applies to individuals with net income above $86,912 in 2026. For every dollar of income above this threshold, OAS benefits are reduced by $0.15, with complete elimination at approximately $141,917 in 2026 income.

### OAS Eligibility

To qualify for OAS in 2026, you must:
- Be 65 years of age or older
- Be a Canadian citizen or legal resident at the time of application approval
- Have resided in Canada for at least 10 years since age 18 (for partial pension) or 40 years (for full pension)

## Planning Strategies for 2026

### Timing Your CPP Benefits

One of the most important retirement decisions is when to start your CPP benefits:

**Start at Age 60:**
- Receive 36% less than your age-65 amount (0.6% reduction per month before 65)
- Good option if you need income immediately or have a shorter life expectancy
- Permanent reduction that continues for your lifetime

**Start at Age 65:**
- Receive your calculated CPP amount based on your contributions
- Standard option for most Canadians
- Balance between earlier access and full benefits

**Start at Age 70:**
- Receive 42% more than your age-65 amount (0.7% increase per month after 65)
- Optimal for those who can delay retirement and want maximum lifetime benefits
- Best strategy for longer life expectancies

### Managing the OAS Clawback

If your income is approaching the OAS clawback threshold, consider:

- **Income splitting**: Pension income splitting with a spouse can reduce your individual income
- **RRSP withdrawals**: Coordinate RRSP withdrawals to stay below the threshold
- **TFSA withdrawals**: TFSA withdrawals don't count as taxable income, helping you avoid the clawback
- **Deferred income**: Consider deferring some income-generating activities until after age 71

### Coordinating CPP, OAS, and Other Income

Effective retirement planning requires coordinating multiple income sources:

1. **Government benefits**: CPP and OAS provide base income
2. **Registered accounts**: RRSP/RRIF withdrawals supplement government benefits
3. **Tax-free savings**: TFSA withdrawals don't affect OAS clawback calculations
4. **Private pensions**: Employer pensions provide additional security
5. **Investment income**: Non-registered investments offer flexibility

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Starting CPP Too Early

Many Canadians start CPP at 60 without considering the permanent 36% reduction. Unless you have health concerns or immediate financial need, delaying can significantly increase lifetime benefits.

### Ignoring the OAS Clawback

Higher-income retirees may not realize their income level triggers the OAS clawback. Careful income planning can help preserve your full OAS benefits.

### Not Applying on Time

You should apply for CPP and OAS several months before you want to start receiving benefits. Service Canada recommends applying 6-12 months in advance.

### Underestimating Government Benefits

CPP and OAS can provide a substantial portion of retirement income. Don't underestimate their value when planning your retirement savings needs.

## Impact of Inflation

Both CPP and OAS are indexed to inflation, which helps protect your purchasing power in retirement. However, understanding how these adjustments work and planning for potential variations in inflation rates is important for long-term retirement planning.

## Working with a Financial Advisor

Navigating CPP, OAS, and retirement planning can be complex. A financial advisor can help you:

- Determine your optimal CPP start date
- Develop strategies to minimize OAS clawback
- Coordinate government benefits with other retirement income sources
- Create a comprehensive retirement income plan
- Plan for tax efficiency in retirement
