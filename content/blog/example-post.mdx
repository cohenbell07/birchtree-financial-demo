# Understanding RRSP Contribution Limits for 2024

As we navigate the 2024 tax year, understanding your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) contribution limits is crucial for effective retirement planning and tax optimization.

## What Are RRSP Contribution Limits?

Your RRSP contribution limit is calculated as 18% of your previous year's earned income, up to a maximum amount set by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). For 2024, the maximum contribution limit is **$31,560**.

## Key Deadlines to Remember

- **March 1, 2024**: Deadline for 2023 RRSP contributions to count toward your 2023 tax return
- **December 31, 2024**: Last day to make contributions for the 2024 tax year

## Strategies for Maximizing Your RRSP

1. **Contribute Early**: The earlier you contribute, the more time your money has to grow tax-deferred
2. **Use Your Contribution Room**: Check your Notice of Assessment from the CRA to see your available contribution room
3. **Consider Tax Brackets**: Contributing when you're in a higher tax bracket maximizes your immediate tax savings
